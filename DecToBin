I used Python3 program to Create a Create a program called dectobin which means Decimal to Binary.
The program should accept input from the command line,the input must be of type int. 
The program should immediately print out the binary representation of the value input by the user


# decimal number to binary number
# function to convert
# decimal to binary

def dectobin(num):
    # array to store
    # binary number
    binaryNum = [0] * num;
    # counter for binary array
    i = 0;
    while num > 0:
        # storing remainder
        # in binary array
        binaryNum[i] = num % 2;
        num = int(num/2);
        i += 1;
        # printing binary array
    # in reverse order
    for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
        print(binaryNum[j], end="");

    # Driver Code

num = int(input("Enter a number:\n"));
dectobin(num);

#on my PC using Command Prompt
# C:\Users\LENOVO pc>python DecToBinary.py
#Enter a number
